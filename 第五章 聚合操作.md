# 聚合操作

常用聚合函数
- MAX()
- MIN()
- AVG()
- SUM()
- COUNT()

注意：
- 操作数可以是数值，也可以是日期和字符串，但是不会操作 NULL
- 如果想要操作所有的记录：使用 *
- 括号里面可以使用表达式：(x * 1.1)
- 也可以先使用 WHERE 子句进行记录过滤，然后使用聚合函数
- 聚合函数不会自动去重，如果要去重还需使用 DISTINCT

```sql
USE sql_invoicing;

SELECT 
	MAX(invoice_total) AS highest,  -- 可以是值 也可以是字符串和日期
	MIN(invoice_total) AS lowest,
    AVG(invoice_total) AS average,
    SUM(invoice_total * 1.1) AS total,
    COUNT(invoice_total) AS number_of_invoices,
    COUNT(payment_date) AS count_of_payments,
    COUNT(*) AS total_record,
    COUNT(DISTINCT client_id) AS total_records
FROM invoices
WHERE invoice_date > '2019-07-01'
```

- 练习：

```sql
SELECT 
	'First half of 2019' AS date_range,
    SUM(invoice_total) AS total_sales,
    SUM(payment_total) AS total_payments, 
    SUM(invoice_total - payment_total) AS what_we_expect
FROM invoices
WHERE invoice_date BETWEEN '2019-01-01' AND '2019-06-30'
UNION 
SELECT 
	'Second half of 2019' AS date_range,
    SUM(invoice_total) AS total_sales,
    SUM(payment_total) AS total_payments, 
    SUM(invoice_total - payment_total) AS what_we_expect
FROM invoices
WHERE invoice_date BETWEEN '2019-07-01' AND '2019-12-31'
UNION
SELECT 
	'Total' AS date_range,
    SUM(invoice_total) AS total_sales,
    SUM(payment_total) AS total_payments, 
    SUM(invoice_total - payment_total) AS what_we_expect
FROM invoices
```

## GROUP BY 子句

对一列或者多列分组

- 求每一位顾客的销售额

```sql
SELECT 
	client_id,
    SUM(invoice_total) AS total_sales
FROM invoices
WHERE invoice_date >= '2019-07-01' -- 先过滤 在分组聚合
GROUP BY client_id  -- 总是在 from 和 where 后面
ORDER BY total_sales DESC
```

- 多列分组

```sql
SELECT 
	state,
    city,
    SUM(invoice_total) AS total_sales
FROM invoices i
JOIN clients c USING (client_id)
GROUP BY state, city --  state 和 city 每一个组合 都会对应一个结果
```

- 练习：

```sql
SELECT 
	p.date AS date,
    pm.name AS payment_method,
    SUM(p.amount) AS total_payments
FROM payments p
JOIN payment_methods pm
	ON p.payment_method = pm.payment_method_id
GROUP BY p.date, pm.name
```

## HAVING 子句

对聚合后的结果进行条件过滤，此种情况下不能使用 WHERE（分组前筛数据），使用 HAVING

HAVING 跟在 GROUP BY 后面，操作分组聚合的结果

- 总销售额大于 500 的客户

```sql
SELECT 
	client_id,
    SUM(invoice_total) AS total_sales,
    COUNT(*) AS number_of_invoices
FROM invoices
GROUP BY client_id
HAVING total_sales > 500

SELECT 
	client_id,
    SUM(invoice_total) AS total_sales,
    COUNT(*) AS number_of_invoices
FROM invoices
GROUP BY client_id
HAVING total_sales > 500 AND number_of_invoices > 5  -- 只能使用 select 选中的属性
```

- 练习：得到住在 vrigina 且花费超过 100 的顾客

```sql
SELECT 
	c.customer_id,
	c.first_name,
    c.last_name,
    sum(oi.quantity * oi.unit_price) AS total_sales
FROM customers c
JOIN orders o USING (customer_id)
JOIN order_items oi USING (order_id)
WHERE state = 'VA'
GROUP BY c.customer_id, c.first_name, c.last_name -- 必须使用 select 中非聚合的属性分组
HAVING total_sales > 100
```

## ROLLUP 运算符

- 仅仅 MySQL 中有这个函数，其他 DBMS 中没有
- WITH ROLLUP 应用于聚合值列，会在这一列最低下给出一个总和
- 使用时，对应的 GROUP BY 后要跟真实列名，不可以使用别名

```sql
SELECT 
	client_id,
    SUM(invoice_total) AS total_sales
FROM invoices
GROUP BY client_id WITH ROLLUP -- 最后
```

- 多列分组中使用 WITH ROLLUP

在多列分组中使用 WITH ROLLUP 时，返回结果会有每个组以及整个结果集合的汇总

```sql
SELECT 
	state,
    city,
    SUM(invoice_total) AS total_sales
FROM invoices
JOIN clients USING (client_id)
GROUP BY state, city WITH ROLLUP
```

- 练习：

```sql
SELECT 
	pm.name,
    SUM(amount) AS total
FROM payments p
JOIN payment_methods pm
	ON p.payment_method = pm.payment_method_id
GROUP BY pm.name WITH ROLLUP  -- 输入实际的列名
```
